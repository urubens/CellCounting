    """
    Extract local maxima whose value is higher a given threshold and that have
    at least at a given distance between them. An optional smoothing can be
    performed before to merge multiple peaks.

    Parameters
    ----------
    scoremap: array-like of shape (width, height)
        The image where to find local maxima.
    post_sigma: float, None, optional (default=None)
        The standard deviation for optional smoothing.
    post_threshold: float, optional (default=0.0)
        The discarding threshold.
    post_min_dist: float, optional (default=7)
        The minimum distance between two peaks.

    Returns
    -------
    mask: array-like of shape (width, height)
        The mask containing local maxima.

    Notes
    -----
    . The code is adapted from skimage library.
